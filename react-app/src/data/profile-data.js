        selfintro: 'My name is Qing Su. I graduated from University of Glasgow with a merit MSc in Investment Banking and Finance in 2014; prior to this, I studied for my BSc at the University of International Business and Economics in Finance. Now titled with Chartered Financial Analyst, I have obtained six year’s work experience in investment and financial risk management.',
        motivate: "I am seeking to achieve professional advancement by pursuing a Master’s degree in Computing and Data Analysis from Saint Mary’s University, Canada. Since I initiated my career in a Chinese local hedge fund, financial modelling and quantitative analysis have become my core professional skills. Though quantitative analysis is powerful in investment and financial risk management, based on my understanding, its perspective has been largely underestimated. Because today, unprecedentedly large-scale industrial application of Big Data is giving us more profound and interesting insights to this complicated financial system."
